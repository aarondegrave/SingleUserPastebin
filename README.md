# SingleUserPastebin
Download files from a users pastebin. This is run on a constant loop and checks every second. This means if someone uploads a new file it will download the file (Unfortunately it will also download all of the files again if there is more than one on the pastebin account)

# Usage
Use SinglePastebinScan.py -h to see the option.
